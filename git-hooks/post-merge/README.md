# post-merge

The `post-merge` hook runs after a successful merge command. You can use it to
restore data in the working tree that Git canâ€™t track, such as permissions
data. This hook can likewise validate the presence of files external to Git
control that you may want copied in when the working tree changes.

## sass_compiler

Compiles sass files to css files, using `SASS_DIR` and `CSS_DIR` environment
variables to find sources and place the results, respectively. Both default to
the current directory.
